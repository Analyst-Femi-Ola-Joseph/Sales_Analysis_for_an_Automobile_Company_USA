# Sales_Analysis_for_an_Automobile_Company_USA
A Data Science Project that Analysed  the sales performance of an Automobile company Based in the United States. The companyâ€™s sales transaction data generated over the past years was used for this  analysis.

## PROBLEM STATEMENT:  
What are the Top Most-Profitable 5 States for the Bike Product Category in the United State ?

## DATA PRE-PROCESSING
#### DATA LOADING
``` Python
## let us import all the necessary python packages 
# solution 
import numpy as np 
import pandas as pd 
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
print("The packages have been successfully imported")
```
``` Python
# Reading the csv files into pandas dataframe

bikes_df = pd.read_csv("C:/Users/steph/OneDrive/Desktop/_DATA SCIENCE BOOTCAMP TRAINING/DATA SET/bikes.csv")

bikes_df.head()
```
#### DATA MODIFICATION
``` Python
# (1). Adding the following 3 columns to your pansdas Dataframe:  bikes_df

# TotalCostPrice : To be obtained by (OrderQuantity x CostPrice_usd)

bikes_df["TotalCostPrice"] = bikes_df["OrderQuantity"] * bikes_df["CostPrice_usd"] 

# SalesRevenue : To be obtained by (OrderQuantity x SellingPrice_usd)

bikes_df["SalesRevenue"] = bikes_df["OrderQuantity"] * bikes_df["SellingPrice_usd"] 

# Profit : To be obtained by (SalesRevenue - TotalCostPrice)

bikes_df["Profit"] = bikes_df["SalesRevenue"] - bikes_df["TotalCostPrice"]

bikes_df.head()

```
## DATA ANALYSIS

#### DATA FILTERING

``` Python
# Filtering out only the data that is relevant to solve the problem statement

is_uSA = bikes_df["CustomerCountry"] == "United States"	

is_bike = bikes_df["ProductCategory"] == "Bikes"

bike_in_the_US = bikes_df[(is_uSA) & (is_bike)]

bike_in_the_US.head()
```

#### DATA AGGREGATION (Data Summary)

``` Python
# Aggregating the total profit by states in the united states for bikes sales or transaction.

total_profit_by_states = bike_in_the_US.pivot_table(values = "Profit" , index = "CustomerState" , aggfunc = np.sum )

total_profit_by_states

```
